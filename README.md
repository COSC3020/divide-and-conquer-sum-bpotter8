# Divide and Conquer Sum

In the lectures, we've covered merge sort, which uses a divide-and-conquer
approach to sort an array of values. There are many more algorithms that take
such an approach. Implement a function that computes the sum of an array of
integers using divide and conquer, using the template in `code.js`. Test your
new function; I've provided some basic testing code that uses
[jsverify](https://jsverify.github.io/) in `code.test.js`.

The recursive calls sum up the numbers in the base case, and "merges" the sums
of the recursive calls otherwise. For example, the return value for the array `a
= [1,5,-1,4]` is `9`.

To make it a bit more interesting, instead of splitting into two sub-arrays like
in merge sort, I want you to split into *three* sub-arrays at each divide step.

Hint: Like in the implementation of merge sort, you may need a helper function
that does the actual recursion.

## Runtime Analysis

What is the runtime of the algorithm that you implemented? Provide a recurrence
relation for $T(n)$ as we did for merge sort (you can ignore constant factors)
and solve it as we did in the lectures. Give the final $\Theta$ complexity.

Describe your reasoning and the conclusion you've come to. Your reasoning is the
most important part. Add your answer to this markdown file.

Solution -
In the lecture, the recurrence relation for a simple mergesort (splitting into two subarrays) is T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n. 
Using this information, we can see that the recurrence relation for the mergesort splitting into three subarrays is T(n) = 3T(n/3) + n.
Using substitution, we can calculate the solution to be (3^i) * T * (n / (3^i)) + (i * n).
In this case, i is equal to log_3(n).
Further simplification proves that this is equivilent to $/Theta$ (n log n).
